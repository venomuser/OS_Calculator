# OS_Calculator
This project is related to Operating Systems' process management algorithms. The user can choose one of the algorithms to simulate the situation. The user should input number of processes, each process's burst time, arrival time, priority, tickets, number of memory blocks and each block's size, based on his/her choise. The user also should define storage quantity of memory (RAM) and also should define number of blocks and their size. 13 Algorithms are implemented, 7 number for CPU scheduling algorithms and 6 number for memory allocation algorithms. The algorithms are these:  
  
CPU Scheduling Algorithms:  
First Come First Serve  
Round Robin  
Shortest Job First  
Shortest Remaining Time  
Highest Response Ratio Next  
Priority  
Lottery  
  
Memory Allocation Algorithms:  
First Fit  
Next Fit  
Best Fit  
Worst Fit  
Fixed Partitioning  
Variable Partitioning  
  
This is a .NET MAUI project and it is multi-platform. This means that the result of the app can be run on Windows, Android, iOS, and Mac. This project may be developed in the future and it may include more equipments.
